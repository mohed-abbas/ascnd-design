// Cloud placement data — plain values, no Three.js/R3F. Kept separate from
// cloud-canvas.tsx so cloud-layer.tsx can read the specs without eagerly
// pulling the heavy WebGL bundle (which stays behind dynamic(ssr:false)).
//
// Position is given in screen-NDC (x,y each in [-1,1] — centre is 0, +x right,
// +y up) so each cloud lands at a fixed spot on screen regardless of viewport;
// <CloudPlacement> projects it onto the camera ray. `dist` is how far along
// that ray to sit and only affects SIZE, not the screen position. bounds/volume
// set the puffiness.
//
// The clouds are split into two DOM layers (see cloud-layer.tsx): SKY_CLOUDS
// render behind the page content; ROCK_CLOUDS render in FRONT of the cliffs so
// they overlap the rock bases. Both share the same camera/lighting, so they
// look consistent — only their z-stacking differs.
